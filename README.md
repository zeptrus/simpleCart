# Simple Cart

## Purpose
* To simulate a simple cart

## Instructions
Run Cart.sln as localhost web

To run Cart.UI.sln you'll need to run 
* npm install
* bower install
* gulp build
* make an unmanaged Application on iis and point it to the dist folder.

I have checking in the dist folder however so you won't have to run those 3 steps if you don't want too.
